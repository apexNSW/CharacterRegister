The SAP1 (Simple as Possible) 8-bit computer was designed by Ben Eater. Complete kits, as well as schematics, part list, and detailed video tutorials can be found at https://eater.net/8bit.  Many thanks to Ben Eater for his amazing work!  The Character Register was designed by apexNSW and is not affiliated with Ben Eater or https://eater.net.    

The Character Register is an additional output register for SAP1, allowing the output of any single 7-bit ASCII character, with the additional 127 characters available for customization.
